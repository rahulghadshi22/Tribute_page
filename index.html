            “Our child has captured three peaks, he had taken the nation by
            storm and suddenly he was no more”. “But when God gives you a mortal
            blow, he gives you the strength to cope with the grief. Guru Gobind
            Singh sacrificed four sons for the country. Maybe there was some
            reason why God gave me twins — one he had marked for the country and
            one for me.”
